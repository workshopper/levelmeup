To get into the rhythm, let's do a simple _hello world_.

Write a Node program that accepts two command-line arguments, **X** and **Y** and prints out to the console the following text:

ALL YOUR **X** ARE BELONG TO **Y**

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

    {appname} run program.js

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

    {appname} verify program.js

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run **`{appname}`** again and select the next problem!
